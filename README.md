# HydrationCoach 💧  
A  Python project that helps users calculate their daily water requirement and receive drinking reminders.

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
HydrationCoach is a small Python application designed using basic programming concepts such as:

- Variables, expressions, statements  
- Functions and modules  
- Conditional statements  
- Loops  
- Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries  
- Algorithm design  
- Program verification  
- Top-down design  
- Analysis of algorithms

## 🔍 Output Information

| File Name | Will It Show Output? | Notes |
|-----------|----------------------|-------|
| *main.py* | ✅ Yes | Shows full summary |
| *calculator.py* | ❌ No | Contains only functions |
| *config.py* | ❌ No | Contains constants |
| *user_input.py* | ❌ No | Returns a dictionary |
| *reminders.py* | ⚠ Sometimes | Works normally in VS Code; Colab pauses time.sleep |
| *test_calculator.py* | ✅ Yes | Prints test output |
| *test_reminders.py* | ⚠ Maybe | Depends on how time.sleep behaves |

## 📘 Algorithm

### Step 1 — Input
Get user name, weight and reminder interval.

### Step 2 — Process
### Step 3 — Output  
Print calculated water requirement.

### Step 4 — Reminder Loop
---

## ✔ Program Verification  
- All functions tested using print()-based tests.  
- Edge cases handled (negative weight, zero values).  
- Reminder loop tested with small 1-second delays.
