# HydrationCoach

A modular Python app guiding optimal hydration using control flow, compound data structures, and reminders.

## Features
- Intake calculation based on personal factors
- Interactive input and tracking
- Practical tips and feedback
- Reminder logic

## Control Flow/Algorithm Outline
- Inputs: weight, activity, climate
- Algorithm: Calculate recommended intake (see pseudocode below)
- Verification: Automated tests for all functions

## Pseudocode

1. Get user weight, activity, climate
2. Compute recommended intake
3. Loop: Collect water consumed until user ends session
4. Assess status (under/optimal/over)
5. Provide feedback and tips

## Flowchart
